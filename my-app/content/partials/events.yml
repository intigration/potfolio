        Flock is the Fedora Project's annual multi-day **in-person**
        conference focused on our contributors. It typically alternates
        between European and North American locations. The conference provides
        a venue for face-to-face meetings and conversations. It is also a
        place to celebrate our community. 


        **Flock typically takes place every August.**
