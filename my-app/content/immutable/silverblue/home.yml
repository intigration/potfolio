title: Fedora Silverblue
description:
  Fedora Silverblue provides the GNOME desktop experience you know and love in
  an immutable fashion.  It looks, feels and behaves like a regular desktop operating system,
  and the experience is similar to what you find with using a standard Fedora Workstation.
  Silverblue's immutable design is intended to make it more stable, less prone to bugs,
  and easier to test and develop. Its also an excellent platform
  for containerized applications, as well as container-based software development. Your apps
  are kept separate from the host system, improving stability and reliability.
