description: Fedora Sericea provides the popular Sway tiling window manager in
  an immutable fashion. It makes Sway accessible and appealing to both novices
  and advanced users who prefer not to use a mouse, touchpad, or other
  pointing device to interact with their environment. Featuring lightweight
  applications for web browsing, text editing, and media playback, the Fedora
  Sericea offers a complete experience with a minimalist user interface.
