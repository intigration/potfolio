          Getting going with Fedora is easier than ever. All you need is a 2GB
          USB flash drive, and Fedora Media Writer.

          Once Fedora Media Writer is installed, it will set up your flash drive to run a "Live" version of Fedora Workstation, meaning that you can boot it from your flash drive and try it out right away without making any permanent changes to your computer. Once you are hooked, installing it to your hard drive is a matter of clicking a few buttons*.
      - description: " * Fedora requires a minimum of 20GB disk, 2GB RAM, to install and
          run successfully. Double those amounts is recommended. "
